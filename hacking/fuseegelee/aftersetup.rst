After Setup (fusee-gelee)
=========================

Congratulations! By this point you have:

* Learned how to enter RCM
* Learned how to launch fusee-gelee payloads through RCM
* Learned how to perform NAND backups
* Learned how to block as much Nintendo telemetry as possible

Launching Atmosphere CFW
------------------------

To launch Atmosphere:

1. Enter RCM on your Switch
2. Push the Hekate payload to your Switch

Hekate will now autoboot Atmosphere. Note that Atmosphere CFW does not look fundamentaly different to the normal Switch operating system. You can verify you are in Atmosphere by trying to load the Homebrew Menu (see below) or checking if the system version string in System Settings contains **(AMS x.x.x)**.


Accessing the Homebrew Menu
---------------------------

Homebrew installed by placing an **NRO** file into the **/switch** folder on your SD card can be launched through the Homebrew Menu.

Access the Homebrew Menu by holding the **R** button while opening **any game, app or the album**. Note that for games, you need to hold **R** *after* choosing a user (if applicable).
